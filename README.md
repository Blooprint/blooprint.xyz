# Please FORK this project and submit your PULL REQUESTS!!!

## Are you a newcomer? Visit our descriptive [WIKI](https://github.com/blooprint/blooprint.xyz/wiki)

## Please become familiar with our core [Blooprint-API](https://github.com/blooprint/blooprint-api), which we're using as the core engine to this project. Blooprint software is an **[extension to the blooprint-api](https://github.com/blooprint/blooprint-api/blob/master/LICENSE)** software. The API returns images for rendering the DOM. It's kept here: **[./api/blooprint.jar](https://github.com/blooprint/blooprint/tree/master/api)**, from **[here](https://github.com/blooprint/blooprint-api/releases)**.

### In the project directory, you can run:
#### `npm i`

# Development Direction

Please refer to any current **[projects](https://github.com/blooprint/blooprint/projects)** for details.

### `Design.js` component - interacts with the blooprint-api: **[see here](https://github.com/blooprint/blooprint/blob/master/api/runAPI.js)**

This is a desktop browser application the whiteboard user interacts with.  **The DOM consists of**:
- The **Blooprint Image**
 - Short-term goal:	a **single full-screen image** generated by the [API](https://github.com/blooprint/blooprint-api)
 - Long-term goal:	unlimited images generated by the API pieced together in an infinitely scrollable XY plane (limited to latest `BLOOP` coordinates)
  - the Blooprint-API `WRITE` or `ERASE` bloop action will have to act upon the multiple images that appear instantaneously in the display range of the full-screen browser - will require further [API](https://github.com/blooprint/blooprint-api) development in order to act upon specific slivers of images that appear in the browser at the time of the `BLOOP`/`ERASE` action
- **BLIP objects** - for search engine optimization. play around with the application - you'll see what they are
