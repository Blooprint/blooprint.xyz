###Blooprint images

####keep this directory as part of the application file structure

This directory is where display images are stored for application usage. These images are what `../blooprint.jar` uses to generate updated versions of whatever particular Blooprint image. Subdirectories are required for user creation of separate Blooprint projects each with their own history line of Blooprint images.  **Blooprint version control data structure is kept in this directory**.
